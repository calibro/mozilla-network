# Mapping the internet health movement

The Mozilla Foundation has committed to ‘fuel a movement with people around the world to build a healthy internet’.  This project experiments with a mix of methodologies to _observe_ and _analyse_ this movement, looking at organizations that are working on some aspect of making the digital world healthier and better.  Internet health is an umbrella term Mozilla uses to talk about issues like openness, privacy and security, decentralization, digital Inclusion, web literacy.

Other organizations use terms like ‘open internet’ or ‘digital rights’ or ‘open source’ to refer to a similar set of issues and organizations. For the purposes of this research, we are treating all of these organizations as part of the same loosely knit movement.

### Goals

The main goals of the project are to provide _data_ and _visual tools_ to the Mozilla Foundation team to understand which organizations are involved in the movement working on internet health issues, how they are related to Mozilla, where they are based, how they act and which issues they work on. The visualizations produced will be used by the Mozilla Foundation team to both situate its current movement building activities  strategy and identify gaps and opportunities for future actions.
